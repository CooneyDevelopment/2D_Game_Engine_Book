Model Space
- Unique to each geometric object

Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC) System
- X/Y axis bounded to +1.0/-1.0
- WebGL draws to this coordinate system.

Transforms (matrix operations)
- performed on the geometric object as it is drawn to the NDC.

World Coordinate System (WC)
- used instead of NDC system to perform transformations that behave as expected
  * avoids the pitfalls of disproportional scaling to the canvas element

View-Projection Transform
- transforms WC into NDC so WebGL can draw.
- mat4.lookAt() --> defines the center of the WC. Returns the View Matrix.
- mat4.ortho() --> defines the dimensions of the WC. Returns the Projection Matrix.
- ViewProjectionMatrix = ProjectionMatrix * ViewMatrix
- gl.viewport() --> defines the viewport for subsequent drawings
